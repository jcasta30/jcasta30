- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there stranger! My name is Jesus Castaneda Magallanes
- I am a current university student, with a goal of earning my bachelors in Computer Science.
- I have mostly worked in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and am familiar with Django. 
- Although, I am hopeful to keep on learning and better my skills and knowledge!
- Check out some projects I have worked on such as a project called _SpilledCoffee_ and another called _CS-4360_.
- These were both projects for two different CS courses.
